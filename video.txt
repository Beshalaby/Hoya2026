                       TRAFIQ HACKATHON VIDEO SCRIPT
                            (Target: 2-4 Minutes)
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VISUAL: Stock footage of bumper-to-bumper traffic. Horns honking.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Every day, Americans waste 8.8 BILLION hours stuck in traffic.
That's not just frustrating—it's $190 billion lost every year."

[TEXT ON SCREEN: $190 Billion Lost Annually]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"What if city traffic could think for itself?"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:45)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VISUAL: Quick cuts - traffic lights turning red, ambulance stuck in traffic, 
exhaust fumes rising.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Current traffic systems are stuck in the past.
Lights run on fixed timers. Cities react AFTER accidents happen.
There's no intelligence. No adaptation. No prediction."

[TEXT ON SCREEN: No Intelligence. No Adaptation. No Prediction.]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: INTRODUCE THE SOLUTION (0:45 - 1:00)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VISUAL: Fade to black, then reveal TrafiQ logo with a subtle glow animation.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Introducing TrafiQ—AI that watches, learns, and optimizes traffic in real time."

[VISUAL: Quick shot of TrafiQ landing page hero section.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Connect any camera. Let our AI see what's happening. 
And get actionable insights—instantly."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: THE LIVE DEMO (1:00 - 2:30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VISUAL: Screen recording of TrafiQ Dashboard]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Here's how it works."

-- STEP 1: THE CALM STATE --
[VISUAL: Dashboard with low traffic. Green heatmaps.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"This is our live traffic dashboard. 
On the left, a real-time map with camera feeds.
On the right, AI-generated statistics: vehicle counts, wait times, and alerts."

-- STEP 2: TRIGGER THE CHAOS --
[VISUAL: Click "Demo: Trigger Accident" button (or simulate an incident).]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Now, let's simulate an accident on Main Street."

[VISUAL: Red alert banner flashes. Map marker turns red. Stats spike.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"The AI immediately detects the incident. 
Look—congestion is spiking. Wait times are climbing."

-- STEP 3: AI RECOMMENDATION --
[VISUAL: Zoom into the "AI Recommendations" panel.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"But TrafiQ doesn't just watch. It advises.
Right here: 'Reroute traffic via 4th Avenue. Dispatch EMS.'"

-- STEP 4: THE FIX --
[VISUAL: Click "AI Optimize" button. Show loading animation.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"With one click, the system re-sequences signals..."

[VISUAL: Map transitions from red to green. Stats normalize.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"And just like that—flow is restored."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: THE IMPACT (2:30 - 3:00)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VISUAL: Analytics page OR impact ticker on Dashboard.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"In this simulation alone, TrafiQ saved..."

[TEXT ON SCREEN, animated in one by one:]
  - 15 minutes of average delay
  - 142 kg of CO₂ emissions
  - $4,500 in estimated economic impact

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Now imagine this running across an entire city. 24/7."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: THE CLOSE (3:00 - 3:30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[VISUAL: Return to the TrafiQ landing page or logo.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"TrafiQ: Smarter traffic starts here."

[VISUAL (Optional): Quick team photo or names on screen.]

NARRATOR (V.O.):
"Built by [Team Name] for [Hackathon Name]."

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Try TrafiQ" with a URL or QR code if applicable.]

[FADE TO BLACK]

--- PRODUCTION NOTES ---

1. MUSIC: Use upbeat, techy background music. Sites like Epidemic Sound or 
   YouTube Audio Library have royalty-free options.

2. VOICE: Record in a quiet room. Speak slowly and clearly. 
   If you don't want to narrate, use text overlays with music instead.

3. SCREEN RECORDING: Use OBS (free) or Loom. Make sure the cursor is visible 
   and movements are slow enough to follow.

4. TIMING: Practice the demo flow BEFORE recording. Know exactly which buttons 
   to click and when.

5. EDITING: Quick cuts keep energy high. Don't linger on any shot for more 
   than 5-7 seconds unless it's critical.
